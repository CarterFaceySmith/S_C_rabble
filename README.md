# CPP_Scrabble

Have you ever thought to yourself, man I'd love to create the game Scrabble in C++ with several imposed limitations and a style guide to follow?


No?

Neither have I.

Set this up by cloning the repo, entering "make clean" in your terminal, then entering "make scrabble". 

Play it by entering "./scrabble".
